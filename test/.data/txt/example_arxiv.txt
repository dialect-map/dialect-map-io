ABSTRACT
We evaluate the three point function for arbitrary states in bosonic minimal
models on the sphere coupled to quantum gravity in two dimensions. The validity
of the formal continuation in the number of Liouville screening charge insertions is
shown directly from the Liouville functional integral using semi-classical methods.

1. Introduction
The Liouville ﬁeld theory approach to 2-D quantum gravity and non-critical string theory arises naturally from the geometry of the 2-D worldsheet [1]. Yet, despite the classical inte- grability of the theory, its quantization is still incompletely understood. Progress was made by assuming free ﬁeld operator product expansions to compute the scaling dimensions of exponential operators [2,3]. The results agree with the worldsheet lightcone gauge approach [4], with matrix models [5,6] and topological ﬁeld theory [7]. Still, Liouville dynamics is not completely equivalent to that of free ﬁeld theory in general [2,8,9]. More recently, it was proposed to push the free ﬁeld approach yet one step further, and to compute correlation functions as in free ﬁeld theory but with the Liouville exponential interaction interpreted as a screening charge [10,11,12,13]. The three point function obtained in this way agrees with matrix model predictions.
In the present paper, we generalize calculations of [10,11] to the case of arbitrary external states in the Kac table of bosonic minimal models [14]. The integration over the constant Liouville mode, which yields the screening charge interpretation to the Liouville interaction, gives rise to a single screening insertion in the Liouville sector. This is to be contrasted with the approach of [12] where the presence of the two Liouville screening charges is postulated. Still, our ﬁnal results agree with those of [12] and also with matrix model calculations.
The number of screening charges (s) brought down by integrating out the constant Liouville mode is not in general an integer in this approach. In [10] it was proposed to rearrange the explicit answer for integer s in a form that formally makes sense for all complex s. The justiﬁcation for this procedure is incomplete. Two meromorphic functions in s that agree on all positive integers need not be the same throughout the complex plane, unless further information on their behavior at inﬁnity provided. We shall justify the continuation of the Liouville functional procedure here by showing that the asymptotics for integral and of the explicit answer in terms of Γ functions in fact agree as well. To do so, we use a semi-classical approximation to the Liouville functional integral precisely valid for s
. This proof completes the justiﬁcation of the formal continuation procedure in s.

The great advantage of the Liouville approach to 2-D quantum gravity is that whatever techniques were used successfully in the bosonic theory can be readily extended to the super- Liouville case. This is particularly important since no matrix or topological ﬁeld theory formulations for 2-D quantum supergravity are presently available. The calculation of the three point function for super-minimal models is carried out in a companion paper [15].

2. General Three Point Functions in Minimal Models
We apply the Liouville ﬁeld theory approach to minimal conformal ﬁeld theory models coupled to two dimensional quantum gravity [3]. A general N-point correlation function, evaluated on a genus p worldsheet is given by

The matter operators ψmatter are spin zero primary ﬁelds of conformal dimension hj. The matter correlation function is evaluated for metric ˆg and genus p within the matter conformal ﬁeld theory [18].

We shall now restrict our attention to the three point function on the sphere (p = 0). To facilitate the computation, we shall concentrate the curvature of the sphere at z = . ∞ In this case, the computation reduces to evaluating correlation functions of free ﬁelds on the plane with the ﬂat metric. We may put the three ﬁelds at (z1, z2, z3) = (0, 1, ). Then the correlation function of the scalar ﬁeld φ reduces to

This form has the advantage that it is manifestly symmetric under the interchange of three ﬁelds, unlike the formula obtained in [18]. It diﬀers from their formula by a normal- ization factor associated with the three ﬁelds. However, it suﬀers from the ambiguity of the type 0/0 when r′, r are integers. These ambiguities only exist in factors which may be absorbed in the normalization of the external ﬁelds. Furthermore, when we combine the matter part with the gravitational part, these ambiguities cancel out. We may take r′, r to be integer when we have combined these factors.
Combining the gravitational part of the correlation function, (2.15), and the conformal ﬁeld theory part, (2.20), the three point function of the minimal models coupled to two dimensional gravity is

In a minimal model, two operators in the Kac table represent the same ﬁeld. Namely, ψmatter q+1−r′,q−r represent the same ﬁeld. The three point functions as computed r′,r above obey fusion rules which are not invariant under the reﬂection (r′, r) r) when applied to one of the three ﬁelds. However, the three point function is invariant when the above reﬂection is applied to two ﬁelds simultaneously (up to the normalization of the ﬁelds). Since (r′ρ′ jρ′ may be assumed to r′ be all of the same sign for the three point function without any loss in generality. We shall treat the two cases when they are all positive and all negative separately.

3. Formal Continuation in the Number of Liouville Screening Charges
Does the formal continuation procedure in the number of Liouville screening operators s make sense? In the derivation of [10], and again in the preceding section, an expression deﬁned only for integer s like formula (2.15), was manipulated in such a way as to obtain an expression that would make sense for all complex values of s, such as in formula (2.24). This type of manipulation may not in general be permitted, as it is inherently ambiguous up to periodic functions.
In this section, we shall compare the ﬁnal formula gotten by formal continuation directly with the Liouville functional integral. We know already that these two expressions agree on all positive integer values of s. Furthermore, we clearly have a meromorphic function of s. Thus, in order to show that the formal continued formula indeed yields the answer for the functional integral for all s, it is necessary to verify that the asymptotic behavior as matches.

A meromorphic function that vanishes on all positive integers, and also at
must be identically zero. Using an analogous result, the agreement on the integers and the asymp- totics, we will have shown the validity of the ﬁnal answer, and thus of the analytic continu- ation procedure.

This is perhaps most easily seen when considering the ﬂat metric on the plane plus a curvature δ-function with charge 2 as z = to make the plane into a sphere. The total number of ∞ zeros of A′ is then 2n, hence deg Q = n + 1. We normalize P such that

Next, we have to evaluate the solutions wk of (3.13) or equivalently the polynomial P . To do so, we slightly generalize a clever trick due to Szego [21]. The Jacobi polynomials y = P (α,β) n

The metric γ is a round metric on the n-covered sphere with curvature 1. Thus (3.27) is an eigenvalue equation for the Laplacian on the sphere (i.e. ~L2) with eigenvalue j(j + 1) = 2. Hence j = 1, and there are 3 normalizable zero modes. Thus 2ν = 3 in (3.5). The 1- loop contribution is easy to compute as well; the small ﬂuctuation problem just yields the determinant of ~L2 on the sphere, which is a number independent of ri’s. So the only relevant term comes from evaluating S1(φo). It is easy to see that this corresponds to letting

There are various potential contributions in this formula that are not of the form (3.5). In each Γ and S-function there are factors of the type ss and eirs with r real. It is straightforward to check that all factors form ss cancel, as well as those of the form eirs, keeping in mind that µ < 0. With a little patience, we can evaluate the leading exponential and power asymptotics of the right hand side of (3.29).

Any zeros and poles on the right hand side of (3.29) can only occur for ρ rational, and when Re (s) > 0, only for ρ > 0. This means that we are dealing with a minimal model with ρ = p/p′, p, p′ relatively prime. If 1 rj ≤ j, rj) is in the Kac table of the minimal model, then the right hand side of (3.29) has neither zeros nor poles. To see this, notice in the last line of (3.29) the ﬁrst factor was already shown to be neither equal to zero nor inﬁnity in a discussion after formula (2.26); whereas the second and third factors are regular by an argument similar to the one after (2.26). The factors on the ﬁrst and second lines in (3.29) have zeros and poles, but these only occur for Re (s) < 0. Operators corresponding to (r′ j, rj) outside the Kac table, may be related by OPE with known singularities to operators within the Kac table plus screening operators. For (r′ j, rj) outside the Kac table, this accounts for the zeros and poles on the right hand side of (3.29).

On the left hand side of (3.29), we have a well–deﬁned Euclidean functional integral for all values Re (s) > 0 provided (r′ j, rj) belongs to the Kac table and no singularities occur as a function of coupling constant. Outside the Kac table, new ultraviolet divergences occur governed by the OPE discussed above.

The diﬀerence of both sides is now a meromorphic function for Re (s) > 0, tends to zero j, rj) s as inside the Kac table, both sides have no poles in Re (s) > 0 and hence are holomorphic in Re (s) > 0. For (r′ j, rj) outside the Kac table, we argued that the singularities on both sides are identical, so that the diﬀerence is again holomorphic when Re (s) > 0. By a standard theorem of complex analysis [22], such a function vanishes identically and hence we have shown the validity of (3.29).
4. Summary
We have shown that the formal continuation procedure proposed in [10] in the case of the 3–point function holds in the case of minimal models, directly from semiclassical methods on the Liouville functional integral. This increases our conﬁdence in the procedure considerably, and puts the free ﬁeld, screening operator approach to Liouville theory on a footing close to equal with the Dotsenko-Fateev approach to calculating correlation functions in minimal models.
We generalized the calculation of [10,11] to the case of arbitrary external physical states in minimal models using just Liouville theory. We obtain the same answer as in [12] who uses two screening operator instead of the Liouville theory. It would be very interesting to generalize this approach to compute N-point correlation functions on the sphere and on the torus. The generalization to supergravity is in a companion paper [15].
