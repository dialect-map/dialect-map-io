# Access NYU Workspace

## About
The complete dataset of ArXiv papers used for this project (~5 TBs) has been stored within
a NYU _Research Workspace_. These workspaces allow us to store massive amounts of data with
a relatively easy access procedure (**reserved for NYU personnel**).


## Access
In order to access a _Research Workspace_:

### 1. Access NYU sub-network
If you are connecting yourself from an NYU office, you are already on the NYU sub-network.
Otherwise, follow any of [these guides][vpn-install-guides] to install _Cisco AnyConnect_ VPN.

### 2. Request access to workspace
After the VPN is configured, you would need to request the _Research Workspace_ owner
authenticated access to their data, through your personal NYU Net-ID. In the case of
this project, the workspace owner is [Quynh M. Nguyen][quynh-github-profile].

### 3. Connect to remove workspace
Finally, connect to the remote NYU _Research Workspace_ following [this guide][nyu-connect-guide],
and replacing `project_name` by `ds_dialect-map`.
